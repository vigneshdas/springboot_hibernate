How To run Spring boot application??

1)Run Application.java class : it has been annotated with @springbootapplication so every thing will be taken care by it
like.. Component scanning startup configuration etc

2)Problem faced ***********
By defaul spring boot will auto scan the package were @springbootapplication annotated class is present
i.e for example com.vignesh has application.java class 
so spring boot will auto scan all the packages starting from com.vignesh
Any package starting from different name will not be scanned

3) In web.xml we configure dispatcher servlet and the we provide url pattern
spring boot default uses "/" patern if we want to overide it then we need to configure mapping externally
See "DispatcherServletConfig.java" class for detail
